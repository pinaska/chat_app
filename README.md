# Chat - App
This is my first attempt of using node.js as a server. 
Goal: to have Twitter-like single Page App (SPA) build with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JS, Jquery (AJAX? not sure yet) on the client-side, and Node, Express and MongoDB on the server-side.

-------------------------------------------

## Dependencies

- JQuery
- Express
- Node
- Body-parser
- Mongodb
- Nodemon

---------------------------------
### personal notes
This is the first time I am using VC Studio built-in terminal - Powershell.

:collision: When I created .gitignore in terminal using echo . > .giignore. it created a .gitignore file but this file was not recognized. It turned out the file was coded in UTF-16, while the rest of project was UTF-8. Once changed, the .gitignore worked.
